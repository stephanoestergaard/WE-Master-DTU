# WE-Master-DTU
I am sharing the tools i am working with on my Wind Energy Master at DTU

## Introduction
I have followed the Wind ENergy Master at DTU and now i am writing my thesis for the course. I have setup an analysis model in Orcaflex of the 'IEA Wind 15-Megawatt Offshore Reference Wind Turbine' put on the 'UMaine VolturnUS-S' floater. The 15 MW OWT has already been modelled (i only bend the blades) and shared as an example by Orcaflex. I have modelled the floater myself using the guidelines given by Orcaflex for the example model of the OC3 floater. Creating load RAO and i am using them for the simulation.

## Controller strategies
Is what I am looking into. I will use the ROSCO controllers IPC functionality and hopefully add something myself to it.

Any intereaction is appreciated. If you can use the models just grab them. If you pick up a mistake in the process please let me know.
